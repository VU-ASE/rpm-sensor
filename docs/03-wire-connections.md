# Wire Connections

There are multiple pins available on this board. You should take a look at the pin overview in the MPLAB IDE to understand the pin connections. You can change the purpose of each pin there as well.

The wiring connections are integrated in the PCB. If you want to change wiring or test the RPM sensor, we recommend that you hook up the sensor to an oscilloscope.
